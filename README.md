# Ignition_Kernel_Growth_Modeling_Project

This repository contains the code used for our research paper on: "Assessment of Machine Learning Approaches for Predictive Modeling of Plasma-Assisted Ignition Kernel Growth ". 

Here's the link to the research paper on ASME: https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-abstract/IMECE2024/88674/1212154

The code includes the implementation of 6 machine learning models including Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). 

Breif description about the project:
*In this study, we explored machine learning (ML) techniques to predict ignition kernel growth, a critical factor in efficient combustion, using plasma-assisted ignition methods. By employing 6 ML algorithms, we modeled temperature profiles under different ignition conditions in methane-air mixtures. Traditional computational models (like Computational Fluid Dynamics or CFD models) are computationally intensive. However, our ML approach provides an efficient alternative, offering reliable predictions with minimal computational resources. This research holds significance for applications in energy efficiency and emission reduction in automotive and aerospace industries.*
